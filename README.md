## ⚡ What is mgmt-boost?  
**mgmt-boost** gives managers superpowers — directly in the tools they already use.  

It’s designed to help leaders:  
- Boost clarity and empathy in messages.  
- Capture quick notes from 1:1s, standups, and retros.  
- Track team morale, productivity, and engagement signals.  
- Get nudges to celebrate wins, unblock progress, and adjust cadence.  

All lightweight, private, and Slack-first.

## 🔑 Core Superpowers  

- **Message Booster** → Rewrites Slack messages for clarity & tone.  
- **Diary & Notes** → Quick prompts for daily focus, meeting reflections, and 1:1 summaries.  
- **Team Pulse Tracker** → Flags silence, low participation, or morale dips.  
- **Recognition Nudges** → Prompts to celebrate milestones and small wins.  
- **Cadence Coach** → Tracks 1:1 and check-in rhythm.  
- **Meeting Reflections** → Turns rough notes into structured insights.

## 🔒 Security First  

- Notes stored in **your Google Drive** (you own the data).  
- No raw Slack/Zoom/Jira content persisted — only derived signals.  
- Processing is ephemeral; insights only.  
- Private by default — only you see your nudges & digest.
