## What is mgmt-boost?
mgmt-boost gives managers superpowers—directly in Slack—without adding another tool.

- Boost clarity and empathy before you hit send  
- Capture quick 1:1 & meeting notes (saved to your Google Drive)  
- Track team pulse (silence, morale, cadence)  
- Get nudges to celebrate wins, unblock progress, and keep rhythm  

Private by default. Notes live in your Google Drive. No raw Slack/Zoom/Jira content stored.

## Core Superpowers
- **Message Booster** – Rephrase drafts for clarity & tone (pre-send)  
- **Diary & 1:1 Notes → Drive** – Structured docs via clean taxonomy  
- **Team Pulse Tracker** – Lightweight signals (silence, participation, sentiment)  
- **Recognition Nudges** – Celebrate milestones and small wins  
- **Cadence Coach** – 1:1 rhythm tracking and reminders  
- **Meeting Reflections** – Turns rough notes into actionable insights  

---

## How it Works
1. **Install** – Add the Slack app; connect Google Drive to create a private *Manager Diary* folder  
2. **Use in flow** – `/boost` and `/diary` right in Slack; we index file metadata only  
3. **Digest** – A short weekly email summarizes signals and suggests next best actions

## Security First
- Notes stored in your Google Drive (you own the data)  
- No raw content persisted from Slack/Zoom/Jira—only derived, anonymized signals  
- Processing is ephemeral; insights only  
- Private by default—no HR/exec visibility in MVP  

---

## Roadmap
- **MVP (Private Alpha):** Slack `/boost` + `/diary`, Drive sync, weekly digest  
- **Next:** Zoom transcripts, Jira/GitHub signals, recognition streaks, morale radar  
- **Later:** Manager Compass dashboard, delegation detector, onboarding companion, enterprise deploy
